# Echo of the Wild Project

This is a simple program designed to play random nature sounds at intervals.

The primary objective of this project is to provide brief, non-intrusive auditory stimuli within a workspace environment. The intention is to aid concentration by momentarily diverting attention from the main task, thus potentially refreshing focus. This approach may be particularly beneficial for individuals who perceive their attention span as limited. By briefly shifting focus away from the primary task, the mind can experience a momentary respite before returning to the task at hand. It adheres to the concept that the most effective form of rest is often a change in activity.

Available commands:

`init` - to start the execution
`stop` - to stop the execution
